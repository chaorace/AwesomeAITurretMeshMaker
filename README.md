# AwesomeAITurretMeshMaker
Tool for making turret detection meshes in AwesomeAI

A simplistic gui tool that downloads an up-to-date nodelist and formats them, with your provided values, into a complete snippet ready to be used in AwesomeAI

A note about code quality:
Hello! This was one of my first experiments with a lot of different Scala concepts, but I also ended up adding on a lot of features I didn't originally plan to include. This, combined with my own laziness, has resulted in a very difficult-to-read, poorly commented, and ugly mess of bad practices and ignored warnings. Don't try to learn anything from this project about scala or coding in general, for your own sake. Thanks for reading!
